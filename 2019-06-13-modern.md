## Auto

Type inference is a game changer. Essentially you can simplify complicated (or unknown) type declarations with _auto_. But it can be a balance of convenience over readability.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    int x1 = 5; // Explicit
    auto x2 = 5; // What's the underlying literal type?
    
    std::vector<std::string moon> = {"Don't", "look", "at", "the", "finger"};
    auto finger = moon.front();

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

And there are a few perfectly valid gotchas that arguably wouldn't make it through code review. Let's create a variable and a reference to it, updating _y2_ (below) also updates _y1_ as expected.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    int y1 = 1;
    int &y2 = y1;
    y2 = 2;

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

But how does _auto_ deal with references? Do you get another reference or a copy? (Hint: auto "decays" to the base type - no consts, no refs).

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    int y1 = 1;
    int &y2 = y1;
    auto y3 = y2;
    auto &y4 = y2;

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Brace initialisers

These take a bit of getting used to but they do give you extra checks. For example the compiler coughs a narrowing warning for the following. The "moon" vector above we could have equally declared without the "=".

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    double wide{1.0};
    float narrow{wide};

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Initialiser lists

We used to create a vector and then push elements onto it (ignoring the potential copy overhead of resizing vectors). But with initialiser lists you can populate containers much more concisely.

Initialise a container.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    std::list v1{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

Initialise a pair.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    std::pair<int, std::string> p1{1, "two"};

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

Initialise more complex types

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    struct S {
        int x;
        struct Foo {
            int i;
            int j;
            int a[3];
        } b;
    };
    
    S s1 = {1, {2, 3, {4, 5, 6}}};

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Range-based for loops

Clumsy explicit iterator declarations can be cleaned up with _auto_.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    for (std::list::iterator i = v2.begin(); i != v2.end(); ++i)
        *i += 1;
    
    for (auto i = v2.begin(); i != v2.end(); ++i)
        *i += 1;

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

In fact we can drop the iterators altogether and avoid that \*i dereferencing idiom.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    for (auto &i : v4)
        i += 1;

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

Note you don't have access to the current index (until C++2a). Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Hold that thought...

## Lambda expressions

Think function pointers but a much friendlier implementation. Call like a regular function or pass them as a parameter. You can also define them in-place so you don't have to go hunting for the implementation like you might if you passed a function name. Here's another new for-loop variation too. Note the use of _std::cbegin()_ rather than the method.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    const auto printer = { std::cout << "I am a first-class citizen\n"; };
    
    // Call like a function
    printer();
    
    // In-place lambda definition
    const std::vector d{0.0, 0.1, 0.2};
    
    std::for_each(std::cbegin(d), std::cend(d),[](const auto &i) { std::cout << i << "\n"; });

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Threads

Thread are much neater than the old POSIX library but futures are really interesting and let you return the stuff you're interested in much more easily.

Define a processor-heavy routine as a lambda. Here the return has been declared explicitly.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    const auto complicated = [](){ return 1; };

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

And effectively push our complicated routine into the background and get on with something else. Note we don't have to actually define what f is thanks to _auto_. (It's actually a _std::future_.)

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    auto f = std::async(std::launch::async, complicated);

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

When we're ready we block to get the value. We could change the return type of complicated() and nothing else needs to change.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    std::cout << f.get() << "\n";

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Optional types

This overcomes the problem of defining a "not initialised" value which is inevitably used to index an array. Your functions can effectively return a "no result". Let's create a container with some default entries.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    std::deque<std::optional> options{0, 1, 2, 3, 4};

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

Make the one at the back undefined.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    options.back() = {};

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

And count the valid entries with the help of a lambda expression.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    const auto c = std::count_if(std::cbegin(options), std::cend(options),	
    	[](const auto &o) { return o; });

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Digit separators

If you're defining hardware interfaces then you'll probably have register maps defined as hexadecimals. Using digit separators can help improve readability in some cases.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    int reg1 = 0x5692a5b6;
    int reg2 = 0x5692'a5b6;
    double reg3 = 1'000.000'001;

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

You can even define things in binary if it's clearer. And also specify the size of a type explicitly – a 32-bit integer, say – rather than letting the compiler decide.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    const uint32_t netmask{0b11111111'11111111'11111111'00000000};
    assert(netmask == 0xff'ff'ff'00);
    assert(sizeof netmask == 4);

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Type aliases

Create type-safe typedefs with _using_. Note the trailing cluster of angle-brackets are parsed correctly in C++11 (no need to insert spaces).

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    using container_t = std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string>>;
    container_t safe;

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Structured bindings

You might declare intermediate variables to make the first/second more meaningful below.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    std::pair<std::string, std::string> chuckle{"to me", "to you"};
    std::cout << chuckle.first << ", " << chuckle.second << "\n";

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

But you can also do it in one expression with structured bindings.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    auto [barry, paul] = chuckle;
    std::cout << barry << ", " << paul << "\n";

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Standard literals
<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    using namespace std::complex_literals;
    using namespace std::string_literals;
    using namespace std::chrono_literals;
    
    // auto deduces complex
    auto z = 1i;
    
    // auto deduces string
    auto str = "hello world"s;
    
    // auto deduces chrono::seconds
    auto dur = 60s;
    
    // Or if you want all the literals
    using namespace std::literals;

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Tuples

Like pairs but better. Arbitrary collection of heterogenous types. You can retrieve values by index (which looks a bit odd) or even by type!

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    std::tuple<std::string, double, int> h1{"one", 2.0, 3};
    std::string << " " << std::get<0> << " " << std::get<1> << "\n";

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## std::byte

When you really want something to be a byte and not something that looks a bit like a char.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    std::byte b1{4};

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Exchanging values

Replace that old declare-a-temp variable idiom with an atomic update. _std::exchange_ also returns the original value.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    int current = 5;
    int previous = std::exchange(current, 6);

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## Things to remove

### inline

Just let the compiler decide what should be inlined. It will probably ignore you anyway.

## Move semantics

This is a biggie that you exploit just by moving to C++11 and beyond. The compiler can now choose to move data where previously it would have copied it, potentially giving huge performance benefits.

## Smart pointers

You no longer need to use new and delete explicitly. Smart pointers clean up after themselves when they go out of scope: Resource Allocation Is Initialistion (RAII).
