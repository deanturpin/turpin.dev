How many times is the destructor called?

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    struct bird {
        ~bird() { std::puts("in a bird"); }
    };
    
    bird in = bird(bird(bird(bird(bird()))));

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

_Once!_

Thanks to C++'s return value optimisation. You can disable this behaviour by passing _-fno-elide-constructors_ to the compiler. Unless you're using a standard later than C++14 then it happens regardless.

So does this mean we can't let copy constructors cause side-effects, lest the compiler doesn't bother calling them?

See c[opy elision](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision) and [run the example](https://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/5c0ff3f3d2d99bea).
