## Bash prompt variables

The escape characters that can appear in the bash prompt are [well-documented](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Controlling-the-Prompt) so let’s not cover that in any detail. But a good starting point is the “user@host:dir” combo, which conveniently is also the _scp_ syntax.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    PS1="\u@\h:\w $ "

<!--kg-card-end: code--><!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    root@kali:/tmp $

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

Variables described in the bash documentation:

> PS1 - The primary prompt string. The default value is ‘\s-\v\$ ’.

> PS0 - The value of this parameter is expanded like _PS1_ and displayed by interactive shells after reading a command and before the command is executed.

> PROMPT\_COMMAND - If set, the value is interpreted as a command to execute before the printing of each primary prompt ($PS1).

## Sequence of evaluation

1. Read user command
2. Evaluate _PS0_
3. Execute user command
4. Execute _PROMPT\_COMMAND_
5. Evaluate _PS1_

_PROMPT\_COMMAND_ seems the perfect place to place arbitrary functions but the terminal doesn't count any characters emitted and you end up with ugly alignment side-effects (more on that below). So let's insert commands directly into _PS1. N_otice I’ve used single quotes to ensure the command is run each time, not just when _PS1_ is set. And we’re doing all our dev “locally” in the shell rather than editing bash configuration files, so we can simply run _bash_ again at the prompt if our experiments have gone awry.

Let's ping a host of interest each time we hit return.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    PS1='$(ping -c 1 -w 1 github.com >& /dev/null && echo OK || echo FAIL) \u@\h:\w $ '

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

Great! When it succeeds. But if it fails and takes even a second to return the prompt becomes unusable.

## Using color

You _can_ use the ANSI _\e[33m_ codes in your bash scripts but I think _tput_ is a far friendlier interface. (You'll still need to know the codes for your compiled code.)

Find out how many colours your system supports and print them.

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    tput colors
    for c in {0..255}; do echo $(tput setab $c) \ $(tput sgr0)$c; done | column 

<!--kg-card-end: code--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2019/06/available-colours-1.png" class="kg-image"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image-->
## Ignoring control characters

If you're using non-printable control characters like setting the colour you must tell the shell not to count them lest it misbehaves. Cursoring through history doesn't work in this example:

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    PS1="$(tput setaf 44)$(date)$(tput sgr0) $ "

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

But we simply need to tell bash to ignore the control characters by enclosing them in square brackets thus:

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    PS1="\[$(tput setaf 44)\]$(date)\[$(tput sgr0)\] $ "

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
## What can we do at the prompt?

How about checking your crypto prices?

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    PS1='$(
    curl --silent "https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=BTC&tsyms=USD" | grep -o [0-9\.]*
    ) \u@\h:\w $ '

<!--kg-card-end: code--><!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    9080.52 root@kali:/tmp $

<!--kg-card-end: code-->

Or displaying the location of your public IP?

<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    PS1='$(
    curl --silent ifconfig.co/country
    ) \u@\h:\w $ '

<!--kg-card-end: code--><!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    United Kingdom root@kali:~/cpp $ 

<!--kg-card-end: code-->
