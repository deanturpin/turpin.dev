Making use of an old Amazon Fire tablet and a cheap Bluetooth keyboard to login to an 8-core Linux instance. The web SSH client doesn't work properly on any browser on my iPhone but inexplicably it's fine in an old Silk! I _think_ there's some JavaScript failing on my modern phone that just gets ignored on the Amazon tablet.
